## What is Mindful Journey?

It is full-stack social networking application for people who enjoy meditation, yoga or other wellness-activities related to mind, body and soul. The app helps people be better informed of retreats or similar events available in the United States. It also allows users to connect with like-minded individuals in a supportive and safe online environment. 

The inspiration behind this idea occurred when I was getting a haircut and my hairstylist told me that she went to Sedona, Arizona for a week-long, all-women yoga retreat. She returned back to Michigan refreshed and stayed connected with the women she met. I asked her how she found out about the retreat and she told me through a friend who heard it through word of mouth. After some research on Google, I learned there was not an application or a website where people could find a list of events. You had to google for a specific retreat or event. I created Mindful Journey as a solution to streamline the process and make it easier for all the events to be found. I also wanted to create a positive, encouraging and safe online environment where people can find information and the support they need.  I am a supporter of mental health and believe it is critical for individuals to take care of themselves, not only physically, but emotionally as well. In our society, we tend to be so busy in our lives that we unintentionally neglect ourselves. Please feel free to watch the demo of Mindful Journey below.ðŸ‘‡

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
